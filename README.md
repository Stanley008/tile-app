# Tile App Calculator

This application helps the installer to calculate room and tile information. It calculates floor, wall and total area in m2 to be covered. It also calculates amount of tiles needed and price of the tiles overall. There is an option to adjust the tile quantity in percentage, as there is always a waste because of bad cuts, bad tiles in a box or tiles that are going to be tiled diagonal.  

User is provided with useful hints how to adjust the tile amount percentage and how the calculations are deleted.
